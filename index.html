  <p>I am Samin Nasr Azadani, a master’s degree in mapping, Geodesy.
I completed my undergraduate studies in Geomatics Engineering at the University of Isfahan in 2019. I recently completed my master’s degree in geodesy with a grade point average of 3.77/4 as the first rank at Khajeh Nasir Toosi UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY in 2022.

I am interested in researching and developing satellite positioning systems, particularly I love to research, learning and expanding my knowledge and experience in smartphone positioning. So I researched the field of data recorded by smartphone GNSS receivers and multipath behavior on these data and improved smartphone GNSS positioning accuracies under the guidance of Dr. Mohammad Mahdi Alizadeh Elizeie. I documented, and these results in my master’s thesis as “Studying multi-path effect in GNSS assisted smartphone precise positioning”, which I presented with grade A+ </p>
